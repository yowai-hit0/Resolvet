### Testing Strategy

- Manual testing for core features
- API endpoint testing via Swagger/OpenAPI
- Error handling validation
- Role-based access testing

### Deployment

**Backend:**
- Environment: Node.js server
- Port: 3001 (configurable)
- Database: PostgreSQL

**Frontend:**
- Environment: Next.js server
- Port: 3000 (default)
- Build: `npm run build`

### Configuration

Key configuration files:
